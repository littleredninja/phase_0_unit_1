## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

HTML is pretty straighforward, but I've always had trouble with containers, remembering the difference between padding and margins, and remembering syntax.  Despite those issues, I like how HTML and CSS are both fairly readable.
