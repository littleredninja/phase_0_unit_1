I am still having trouble understanding display, position and pseudo-classes in css.  I couldn't figure out how to place a caption over a photo;  it's something I'll have to fiddle with this next week.  I was able to successfully make a opacity hover for an image, so I'm excited about that.   

I also had to google some examples of syntax, but I don't particularly like the sites I've been using.  Is there more reliable source that www3 schools?
