Hi everyone!  Thanks for sharing your work - I love seeing what other people have done and I look forward to pairing with you all soon!  

Name:  Jennie

Location:  Virginia Beach, VA

Favorite websites:  I'm an severe internet junkie, so it's difficult to choose!  But in my tech blog I wrote about www.pinterest.com, www.tumblr.com and www.photojojo.com.    

Gregoric Thinking Style:  It was a tie between Concrete Random and Abstract Random.  I guess I'm just Random?

Learning style:  Multimodal

I'm from Virginia Beach, but Joey and I have been on the move since we got married 8 years ago.  We've lived in Hawaii, Japan, Florida and lately (as in 12 days ago) we just got back from living in Honduras for two months.  I studied photography at a tiny school in Baltimore (holla Jeff!) called the Maryland Institute College of Art, and I've worked off and on as a writer/photographer/editor since then.  

I love photography, traveling, the beach, hiking, learning languages, my beloved cat and my bearded husband (holla Joey!).

I'm excited to embark on this journey of learning to code.  I love building and making things, and I love the internet, so the idea of learning to build web applications is really exciting to me.  

We're on a super flexible schedule during Phase 0 and therefore available for pairing almost anytime.  Just let us know, and happy coding!

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I really enjoy seeing other boots' websites.  It's been reassuring to read other blogs and know that some of their thoughts and fears are along the same lines as my own.  I'm feeling tired, but excited that I made it through the first week of prep!  Phew!
