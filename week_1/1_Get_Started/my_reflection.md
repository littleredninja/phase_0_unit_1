## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I'm getting the concepts behind Git and Github, but I'm not sure that I will as quickly grasp how to maneuver in these systems.  I"m interested to start working in both and see if I understand the technicalities of how to use them.  

Git is a installed application that allows you to track and save changes to a project, while Github is a web application that allows you to share and collaborate with others on a project using multiple branches that can later be merged to a master project file.  You access Git through your computer's terminal, and you access Github through the internet.  

Version control allows a user to track changes to a project, thereby allowing him to revert to an earlier version should he make a mistake or wish to backtrack.  Github allows the user to maintain this option when collaborating with others by creating mutliple copies of a project that can be merged to include every user's changes, ensuring that collaboraters have access to the same master file and are able to work without saving over another collaborator's work.

Developers use version control to keep track of changes they've make to their code.  The ability to go back to earlier versions of their code allows them to try out different solutions without fear of messing up a project beyond repair.  As an artist and writer, I can appreciate the need and desire to preserve versions of your work.  The practicality of having an application track changes and manage versions sounds great to me. 

Some of the terminology is a little difficult to wade through, and I'm a little overwhelmed by all of the new terms.  There's been a lot of Googling.  I think I've got the difference between Git and Github down.
