## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a respoitory on GitHub, log in and find the plus symbol at the top right of the page.  Click new repository. Fill out the form, and ensure that your username is in the name of the new repository.  Click settings in the form, then check the box marked issues so others can view your work.  Then click repository and your repository is made!  To clone a repository to your local computer, open up the GitHub app on your computer.  In the left column, find and click your username.  In the right window, choose your repository and click clone to computer. Voila!  Cloned.  

Open source means the source code is available for the public to see, edit and use.  I like the idea of a global community sharing code to develop all sorts of programming functionality that might not otherwise be developed but for such a collaborative effort.  I can envision cases where such efforts would not be practical, especially in cases where security is a primary concern.  But I like regarding open source code as a huge library of code that can be developed, adapted, gleaned for ideas and used for shortcuts.  I'm a big believer in the notion that sharing ideas freely makes the world a better place.

Licenses provide terms for how code can be used.  Terms can included crediting, commercial use and distribution.  Developers can use licenses to provide a degree of protection for their work while allowing others to use their work.  

I haven't found any yet, but I'm always on the lookout.
