## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The article on DNS was the most enlightening piece of writing that I've read in the past few years.  I rely so heavily on the internet that if the connection in my house goes out for a span of time longer than three minutes I feel like I've lost an eye.  But despite maintaining a reputation for being rather tech-saavy, I frequently discover that I know relatively little about how the internet actually operates.  There are alot of terms that I just gloss over, and now I feel like I'm beginning to turn the corner on how the technical side of my beloved internet actually works.  Learning how computers find webpages was very interesting, and yes, I do recognize how nerdy I am for saying so.  

You'll need a domain name, a server, and an index page.  Your domain name needs to point to the IP address of your server.  

I love seeing web pages I've made!  I like making things, and it's very exciting to type an address in a browser and find something you've made.  It's almost like a secret gallery where your work is displayed.  Granted, this particular page is currently two words on a white page, but it has the potential to be so much more!

I haven't yet had a chance to wander about the web looking for additional resources, but I like the one's we've used so far.  I also started a Pinterest board to collect the resources I really really like, or the ones I know I'll have to read more than once to fully understand.  There's not much on it right now, but if you want to follow along it's here:  http://www.pinterest.com/littleredninja/interwebs-i-will-develop/.
