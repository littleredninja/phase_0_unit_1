Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

Researching a blog post on your favorite websites is incredibly difficult, because I love my favorite websites and find that they constantly distract me from things I actually need to do.

But seriously, I enjoy blogging and don't mind the process of writing articles, especially articles regarding my own opinion of things.  

I ran into some troubles with my css syntax, but I feel like this is a byproduct of feeling like I need to keep up and thus rushing through my studies and my projects.  When I feel myself hitting a wall, I try to take a break and get a snack, but with this method of coping I may end up eating an awful lot of cookies, cakes and other tasty treats.
