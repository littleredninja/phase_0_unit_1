# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I think my biggest time management challenge is keeping on task while I'm working.  I've dealt with this issue in the past because I get distracted easily, so I've found a few ways that work for me.  Managing my enviroment is key, and so I normally work best in a space that is not my house and I listen to music to limit outside distractions.  

I have in the past worked with a timer, and I like that idea because I've read that if you give yourself a shorter amount of time to finish a project than you think it would take, than you generally finish your task faster.  I also find that if I am working toward a goal, even if its just a time goal, I tend to be more focused in my work.  

I'm not currentlly working;  We made a plan so that I could dedicate this time specifically to working on Phase 0.  We have a dedicated space in the day for studying, prayer, food and family.  We're currently trying to encorporate exercise into our day as well.  So far this plan has been working, and I'll be working over the next few weeks to make my time at the computer even more efficient.
