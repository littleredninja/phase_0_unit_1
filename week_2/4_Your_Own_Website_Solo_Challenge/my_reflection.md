# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I've always been interested in design and so I already understood alot of those concepts, but I was particularly interested in the user experience articles and tips.  I like learning and thinking about how people move through and react to a website, and I learned about programming details to consider when designing, including web accessiblity and designing for performance.

I enjoyed working on my site, although I had a lot of trouble.  I felt like I understood the concepts of building a site in HTML, but everytime I tried to apply something elements would not behave in the way I expected them to.  I'm still confused by what happened in several instances.  Something that solved one mystery was a CSS reset, and so I'm more apt to use those in the future to begin with.
