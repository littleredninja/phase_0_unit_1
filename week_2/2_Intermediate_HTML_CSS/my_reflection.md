# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I'm a big fan of standardization.  In my former life as an editor, I had to do a lot of reading and standardizing of text, and so as a result I prefer for things to all be the same, even when they might be "wrong".  Standarizing code makes things easier to read when one has to look at another programmer's code, and I like that.  For the most part, I think the semantic tags are rather intuitive anyway, so for me it doesn't seem like a bad development.  On the other hand, I can see where other people might prefer to maintain the flexibility of less standarized code as well.

In my former life I had to work a lot out of Microsoft Word.  While one of the more popular word processers in the general public, for designers it has to be one of the most annoying programs ever invented because of the weird hidden characters and commands it puts on documents.  So anytime I worked with a document in it, I always hit the "no formatting" button to take away any styles as best I could.  I consider a reset css as the exact same thing but for a webpage - It just takes away any formerly imposed stlyes and lets you start on a clean slate for your webpage.  

I use Safari, Firefox and Chrome personally, and at work I have often used IE.  I have noticed how things look different on different browsers, and it's made me sad and frustrated, especially because as a budding designer and programmer, I didn't really understand why or how to fix it.  I have a better understanding why now, and realize that such a consideration has to be part of the process.
