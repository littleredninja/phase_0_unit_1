# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think responsive web design is important because when we're trying to communicate anything online, we'd like to be as effective as possible.  Web pages are all about communication, and the better we can design our content so users can effectively understand, interact and use the information we're presenting, the better we've accomplished our mission.  Reading something meant for a big screen on a small screen is annoying, and vice versa.  Responsive design becomes the best answer to those types of issues, and is increasing important due to the omnipresent usage of mobile devices.  

Smartphones and tablets of all types mean that we have no control over the size of the screen users will view or content.  There is no standard, there are no exact gates to meet.  You have to be flexible, and design for many different viewing options. 

I believe as much as we can we should accomodate all types of users, including the visually impaired.  Adding the details for screen readers makes all the difference for people who need it.  

I think this unit just illustrated to me how many details and considerations are neccessary to produce a web app or page that people can use and use well.  Knowing your audience is key in any type of communication, and when developing and desiging for the web, your audience becomes rather enormous and varied.  It's important to consider your demographic, and then accomadate them with every possible tool at your disposal.
