# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The Document Object Model defines properties of website.  The DOM says that websites are HTML documents with nested objects or elements that have specific relationships to each other.  I still haven't fully grasped what this means - is the DOM a manual?  A document?  

The wordpress side was obviously more complicated than my own sites, and while I've used Wordpress before I have to say I haven't always understood exactly how their blogs work.  There were several elements I didn't recognize, including role, links with various rels, and lots of javascript.  

I like the Chrome Web Tools now that I understand them better.  I have "used" them before, and when I say used I mean I opened up the window and putzed around looking at things without really understanding what they did.  I especially liked the netork tab - I thought this was really interesting in showing how a webpage loads.
